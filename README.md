### Score ###
The game saves high scores in a plain text file in current directory. You get 10 points for a burned line, 100 points for double, 1000 points for triple and 10000 for quadruple. You get 1000 times more if you clear the whole field. So the best strategy is to burn four lines at once, leaving nothing behind, for which you will get 10 million points.
